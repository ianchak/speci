REVIEW focusing on:

- What is the optimal order for implementing changes?
- Which changes should be grouped together?
- What are the dependencies between changes?
- What milestones make sense?
- How should work be phased?
- What quick wins can be done first?

EDIT the plan file:

- Add implementation order recommendations
- Group related changes into phases
- Add a row to Section 12 (Review Log) with your review findings

CRITICAL: Use replace_string_in_file or multi_replace_string_in_file to write improvements INTO THE PLAN FILE.
